1. The abstract class can be extended, and you can inherit the code. 
This can occasionally be more practical than sharing code through static methods or object composition.

2. To assign an object to each of the target lists, from left to right, an assignment statement evaluates the expression list
 (note that this can be a single expression or a comma-separated list, the latter of which yields a tuple).

3. Since base classes frequently create member variables and initialize them to default values, 
calling base class _init__ is necessary in every case. Therefore, 
if base class init is not called, none of that code will run and you will end up with a base class that has no member variables.
